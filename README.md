Robot Projects for Robotics Cluster at UCSD COSMOS

Projects: 
1) Scribbler: programmed a premade robot to create a drawing by moving it across the floor with a set of instructions and a pen
2) MazeChallenge: Scribbler put into a maze and shown either a pink or yellow image which indicated to turn right or left to start the maze challenge; used image processing to decode the color and initial direction; used IR sensor built into Scribbler to navigate the rest of the maze 
3) Car: designed an octogon-shaped car to compete with other cars in a battle-royale where each car had a balloon and the goal is to pop others balloons and the last car with its balloon left is the winner; controlled cars with an android app via bluetooth
4) WalkingRobot: made a spider-like robot woth only 2 legs
